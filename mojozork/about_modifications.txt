To give me a z-machine with a classic Infocom presentation, I modified mojozork.c to include VT100 terminal character codes and more fflush(stdout) calls for realtime updates. 

vt100test.c is just a sample project I did to make sure the character codes were doing what I expected before putting them in place into the z-machine code.

The original project pointed to a zork.dat file, but I switched the internal reference in main() to zork1-r88.z3 and it has worked just fine.

Compile this single .c file with `cosmocc` as
`cosmocc -o mojozork mojozork.c`

On Windows, append a `.com` or `.exe` file extension to the built executable to make it happy. From a terminal or PowerShell just `./mojozork` with `zork1-r88.z3` in the same directory.
